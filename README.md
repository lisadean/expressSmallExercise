You'll create a very small website for a restaurant.

You don't have to style it - this exercise is just to help you practice creating routes.

Create a new express app, and add routes for the following:

* / - the home page
* /about - a description
* /menu - a listing of different food items

Feel free to use dummy text/images on all pages.
